#Tongji_Software2020
1. Overview

  Our project aims to design a metabolic platform that simulates changes in the metabolic network to provide comprehensive results for the researcher. You can take the data from our platform, search the pathways between molecules, and perform the metabolic simulations mentioned above.
  
2. How to get starting in web

  These functions hosted on the web are divided into three main modules: Synthetic Bay (DB), Pathway Finder (PF), and Deep Metabolic Simulation (DMS). 
  Through ‘www.tjigem.com’ or ‘https://www.tjigem.com’, we can enter the Home page of the project.
  On this page, users can get our project’s leading content and this manual (Handbook) of the software. At the same time, they can enter the three functional pages by clicking the navigation card. If you want to get more details, read handbook.pdf please!
  
3. How to build this project in your computer
 
  Meanwhile, you will find some alternative parameters to get more different results in our DMS code. You can choose better value or functions according to your demand. And we will instruct you how to deploy. More details, read deploy.md please!
